# Wikipedia dumps

According to [this idea](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42983236/making-a-tree-of-wikipedia-links) I will put the wikipedia dumps here and there processed-version too. Will not be follow by git because there is a few GBs woth of data

The `xml` files tells which dumps are currently downloaded (those are followed by git btw)
