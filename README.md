The goal is making resumes of users' contributions at the Wikimedia Foundation (Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wiktionary, ...)

We parse the contributions of a user (given by Wikimedia's APIs) and display them in a user-friendly and understandable way in order to quickly know in which domain a given user contribute the most and how important/relevant his contributions are.
